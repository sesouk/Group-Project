# Stop-N-Shop
Stop-N-Shop is a team developed eCommerce web application developed as a way to build on concepts and features of a basic eCommerce web application. Payment processing, item details/quantities, orders, user info, storing cart sessions, were all added to build upon a basic shop page and cart page.
